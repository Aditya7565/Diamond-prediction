# Diamond Prediction Project

This project implements and compares various machine learning algorithms to classify and analyze the characteristics of diamonds using the popular [`diamonds`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html) dataset.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use multiple machine learning approaches to predict the `cut` (quality) of diamonds and to analyze their attributes. This includes supervised models for classification and unsupervised learning for clustering. The results of these models are visualized and compared.

## Algorithms Used

The following models and techniques are implemented and evaluated:

- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Neural Network**
- **K-means Clustering**

Each model is evaluated for its accuracy, and the results are compared in a summary bar plot.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Aditya7565/Diamond-prediction.git
    cd Diamond-prediction
    ```

2. **Open R or RStudio**

3. **Install Required Packages** (if not already installed)

    ```r
    install.packages(c(
      "class", "gmodels", "ggplot2", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "neuralnet",
      "e1071", "arules", "cluster", "nnet"
    ))
    ```

4. **Run the Script**

    Load and run the `my_project.R` script in your R environment:

    ```r
    source("my_project.R")
    ```

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or above recommended)
- The following R libraries:

  - class
  - gmodels
  - ggplot2
  - rpart
  - rpart.plot
  - neuralnet
  - e1071
  - arules
  - cluster
  - nnet

## Project Structure

```
.
├── my_project.R      # Main R script containing all code
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Results

- **Visualization**: The script generates bar plots and histograms for data exploration.
- **Accuracy Comparison**: All models' accuracies are shown in a summary bar plot.
- **Confusion Matrices**: Printed for each classification model.
- **Clustering**: K-means clustering results and accuracy are displayed.
