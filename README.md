# Diamond Prediction Project

A comprehensive R project for predicting the quality of diamonds using multiple machine learning algorithms on the famous [`diamonds`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html) dataset.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project demonstrates and compares the effectiveness of several machine learning models for predicting the `cut` (quality) of diamonds. The workflow includes data preprocessing, training, testing, clustering, and visualization.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
- Implementation and accuracy comparison of:
  - **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
  - **Naive Bayes**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Neural Network**
  - **K-means Clustering**
- Model performance visualization

    install.packages(c(
      "class", "gmodels", "ggplot2", "rpart", "rpart.plot",
      "neuralnet", "e1071", "arules", "cluster", "nnet"
    ))
    ```

3. **Run the Main Script**
    - Open `my_project.R` in R or RStudio
    - Source or run all lines in the script
